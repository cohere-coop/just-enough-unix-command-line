# The Terminal

Start by firing up your Terminal. If you've never done that before, you can use Spotlight to search for it (press Command and the space bar, then type "Terminal" and press enter). Make sure you pin it to your dock for easy access in the future. If you're successful, you'll have a command prompt!

A quick side note: if you're like most users, Terminal will place you in your home directory, which is denoted by the tilde ("~"). Typing "~" anywhere you would input a folder name will reference your home directory, just like a shortcut. There's a similar shortcut for your "root directory", which is represented by the forward slash ("/").
