# Introduction

One thing that separates advanced practitioners from beginners is the comfort and ease with which they use the UNIX command line. The command line, while intimidating can make many tasks easier and faster. Learning the command line allows you to speak directly with the computer; instead of having to wade through a translator.

While it may seem like we're starting off slow, we have to be able to walk before we can run. The first few chapters make sure your comfortable with the basics and fundamentals. The middle includes more intermediate theory and commands. The final chapters will demonstrate how to connect the principles behind the UNIX command line and the built in commands on your computer.

Before we begin, I'm going to assume that you're using OSX. Command line in a Windows environment isn't too different, but for simplicity's sake, we'll stick with the Mac. I'm also going to assume you're using bash for a shell. Personally, I use zsh, but most computers are configured with bash to start out with. Either way, you'll be able to follow along with this guide.
