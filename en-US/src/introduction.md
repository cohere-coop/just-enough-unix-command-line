# Introduction

One thing that separates advanced practitioners from beginners is the comfort and ease with which they use the UNIX command line. The command line, while intimidating, can make many tasks easier and faster. Learning the command line allows you to speak directly with the computer instead of having to wade through with a translator.

While it may seem like we're starting off slowly, we have to be able to walk before we can run. The first few chapters make sure you're comfortable with the fundamentals. The middle includes more intermediate theory and commands. The final chapters will demonstrate how to connect the principles behind the UNIX command line and the built-in commands on your computer.

For those of you using a Mac or Linux computer, you have the UNIX command line already! Congratulations! For those of you on Windows, you'll need to install [Linux within a Virtual Machine](http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Ubuntu-on-VirtualBox).
