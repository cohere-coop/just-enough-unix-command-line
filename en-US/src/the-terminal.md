# The Terminal

Start by firing up your Terminal. If you've never done that before, you can use Spotlight to search for it (press Command and the space bar, then type "Terminal" and press enter). If you're successful, you'll have a command prompt! Make sure you pin the Terminal application to your dock for easy access in the future.
