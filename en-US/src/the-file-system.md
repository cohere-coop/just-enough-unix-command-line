# The File System

If you're like most users, the Terminal will place you in your home directory, which is denoted by a tilde ("~"). Typing "~" anywhere you would input a folder name will reference your home directory, just like a shortcut. There's a similar shortcut for your "root directory", which is represented by the forward slash ("/").
