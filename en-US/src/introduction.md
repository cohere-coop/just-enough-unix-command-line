# Introduction

One thing that separates advanced practitioners from beginners is the comfort and ease with which they use the UNIX command line. The command line, while intimidating can make many tasks easier and faster. Learning the command line allows you to speak directly with the computer; instead of having to wade through a translator.

We're going to start off slow, getting you accustomed to navigating your computer using the Terminal application, but as we go, you'll learn more and more commands, along with some bonus efficiency tips and exciting command line theory! Remember, it's important to take it slow and build a solid foundation, but soon you'll be hacking away like a pro.

Before we begin, I'm going to assume that you're using OSX. Command line in a Windows environment isn't too different, but for simplicity's sake, we'll stick with the Mac. I'm also going to assume you're using bash for a shell. Personally, I use zsh, but most computers are configured with bash to start out with. Either way, you'll be able to follow along with this guide.
