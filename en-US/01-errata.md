# How To Read This Book

This book is based on a series of blog posts designed to help beginning programmers familiarize themselves with the Unix command line. They were written by author Jessica Dillon while she worked for Quick Left, and originally appeared on the Quick Left blog.

They are reprinted in the order they were originally written and published, except the “tips and tricks” section was moved from the end to near the beginning.

This book may be read in order, or readers may look in the table of contents or index for topics and commands they would most like to focus on, and read the book in the order they choose. The table of contents lists the commands covered in each chapter.
